# ChatGPT

### I used OpenAI's Whisper to get the text and chatGPT to summarize the 7 ideas. Here is what it gave me.

1. Using an API to create applications that utilize the information and data provided by chat GPT (such as Linsa).

2. Creating value by streamlining information and making it convenient for users (like Linsa did with their Magic Avatar product).

3. Implementing chat GPT's API into your own front end software platforms.

4. Using chat GPT directly to find a specific use case, create a website or front end, and market the service to people who could use it.

5. Creating a chatbot for customer service or sales.

6. Using chat GPT to create personalized marketing campaigns.

7. Using chat GPT to generate content for social media or websites.
